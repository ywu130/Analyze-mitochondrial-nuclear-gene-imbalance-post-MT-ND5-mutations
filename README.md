# **Mitochondrial and Nuclear Genome Encoded Mitochondrial Gene Imbalance Analysis**

This repository analyzes the imbalanced transcriptomic response upon induced **MT-ND5** mutations.  
It is part of my research project investigating the interplay between mitochondrial and nuclear genome-encoded mitochondrial gene regulation.

---

### **About the Analysis**
This analysis explores:
- The transcriptomic changes triggered by MT-ND5 mutations.
- The imbalance in mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded gene expression.
- Insights into how these mutations affect cellular and mitochondrial functions.

---

### **Data Source**
The data used in this analysis comes from the **DEG Analysis Repository**, where differential expression analysis was conducted.  

---

### **Project Goals**
The primary objectives of this project are:
1. To identify key transcriptomic alterations linked to MT-ND5 mutations.
2. To study the broader implications of these mutations on mitochondrial and nuclear gene regulation.
3. To explore potential biological pathways involved in these responses.
